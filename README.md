RTOS Assignments

### Assignment 1: Echo Engine and Database Engine Using Message Queues
### Assignment 2: Echo Engine and Database Engine Using Sockets
### Midterm: Co-Routines and Real time data collection system
### VOIP Assignment: Integration of PulseAudio API with Sockets
### Project: Room Occupancy Detector
The project consists of multiple HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors interfaced on a Raspberry PI 3 to determine the occupancy of a room that has a entry/exit point. Synchronization between the multiple sensors and nodes is to determine how many people have  entered/exited simultaneously. This is achieved using Finite State Machines (FSMs). During the working of the project, various test cases have been considered and the results have been documented in the report.
